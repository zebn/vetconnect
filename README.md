Vetconnect offers users the possibility to communicate with qualified veterinarians from any part of the world, eliminating geographical barriers and facilitating access to specialized veterinary services.

To achieve this objective, a user management system was implemented to guarantee the security and privacy of information. Communication between users and veterinarians is carried out using WebSocket technology, allowing for smooth and direct interaction.

In addition, the platform includes an administration panel that provides administrators with the ability to manage users, track consultations, and carry out other administrative tasks efficiently.

As a result, an effective and user-friendly tool has been created that benefits both users and veterinary professionals, improving access to animal health services and promoting faster and more personalized care. In summary, this project represents an innovative and practical solution for online veterinary consultations, with the potential to positively impact the quality of life of pets and their owners.
